Current issues:

footer on contact and portfolio is covering main container in ipad view; porfolio also on imac desktop
iphone x looks like images/text in main container are off to the right some


possible solutions: 

make separate containers for contact and portfolio (don't just use main container for everything)
see about creating a separate media query for the iphonex size that adjusts the margins or padding in main container
include footer in wrapper?

take away positioning on main container once switching footer position to static
